I'm currently trying to get my hands on more and more backend web developement tools and in this I'm in the "node phase". :P
<br>
This Repositary contains my mini-projects based on node.js and express.

<hr>
# Usage

- Clone the repositary and navigate to the folder
```
    git clone https://github.com/anurag-ux/nodejs-mini-projects.git`
    cd nodejs-mini-projects
```
- go to any project folder and install the dependancies.
```
    cd {project-name}
    npm install
```
- thats it! now you can run any project by starting the server
```
    node app.js
    go to the local server at http://localhost:3000/ and start exploring!
 ```
